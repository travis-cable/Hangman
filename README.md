# Hangman
Attempt to train a Reinforcement Learning model to beat the child's game Hangman in 6 attempts or less.

This attempt was a coding interview in which you are given a dictionary of ~250K words (not provided herein for copyright purposes) and asked to train a model which could beat Hangman on a disjoint dictionary. I attempted both both pure statistical and Machine Learning approaches, but wasn't able to get either model to better than 30% success rate.

Anyone that wants to adapt will need a dictionary of words (between 1 and 30 letters) in a text file with each word in a separate line. If anyone does figure out how to properly train the model PLEASE let me know!
